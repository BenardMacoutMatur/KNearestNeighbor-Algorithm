    <p>The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems.
    </p>
    <p>KNN is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in machine learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection.

It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data).
